# Automic-interviewing-system-using-artifical-intelligence-
Designed AI organization automated interviewing system 

**Introduction :**

AI organization JOKO is a automated interviewing system used to replace manual screening of orgnaization by using:
Name of the product is AI organization Joko. 

-It can perform three task **entrance** , **receptionist** and **interviewer**. 

World is shifting to Artificial intelligent products as these products are fully automatic. Organizations will not need more man power for their organization like they don’t need any person for just to enter or exit a person record. Receptionist can also be relax by using simple AI product that greet vistor and have a check on last visit for interview. Organization get relax for short listing candidates.  

**Main research Features of this Projects are :**

-Automated Gender Class classification using deep learning libraries

-Emotion and confidence level checking using speech 

-Question and answer generation and evaluation relaed to domain

-Intial Screening and Final interviewing screening using natural language processing 

**LANGUAGES**

• **Python**
Python is dynamically and loosely type language. Python has many libraries for Users as they want to work. AI libraries is already available in python. We need just install and import library for use. 

•**Threading **

Threading is use for run multiple function at a same time without any effect on other thread until thread is dependent. 

•**Pyttsx3 **

Pyttsx3 is use 6855

**Techniques used **

•**Python**
Python is very powerful language for anything we want. We choose this language because support of AI is best in python then other languages. Python is easy and faster to learn. 

•**NLP **

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in this project as we need to filter out text and find context of sentence. NLP is best way to doing this.   

•**Speech recognizer**
We used speech recognizer for convert voice to text. We need convert voice into text then perform different task on that text

•**Face recognition **

We have used Face recognizing technique to detect person face for perform different task. 

•**Transformers**

We have used transformers for implementation context extraction from given sentence. Mostly used in Q/A sessions for this purpose.

•	**Spreadsheet**

	We saved data in spreadsheet for in and out of a person. 


**Technolgies used **

•	Computer vision
